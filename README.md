# Onto2Graph

Onto2Graph is a tool based in Java that is able to generate graphs in different formats from ontologies in several formats like: obo, owl and so on.  Basically, the tool is based on OWLAPI library to load the ontologies and then, it enables to use different reasoners to infer a graph from the ontology. Once the graph is built, different libraries have been integrated in the tool to transform it into different formats such (RDFXML, GRAPHVIZ, FLATFILE and GRAPHML).   

# Dependencies

The working of the tool is based on the following libraries:

1. Elk-owlapi reasoner: This library contains the reasoner that is used to infer the classes in the ontology given.
2. HermiT: The other reasoner that has been included in the tool.
3. JGrapht: A graph library that is used to generate graphs from the ontology given.
4. OWLAPI-osgidistribution (version 4.0.2): Library used to manipulate ontologies.
5. Jena-Apache (version 3.0.0.2): Library used to generate the RDFXML Graph.

# Execution

The application does not have a GUI, it is a command line application. These are the parameters that Onto2Graph needs to run:
      
1. -ont: This parameter specifies the path where the ontology is located.
2. -out: This is an optional parameter and it represents the output path where the files generated by the tool will be saved.
3. -r: The reasoner will be used to infer the ontology. Currently, these are the reasoners that have been included:
	3.1. ELK: Elk reasoner is the default option.
	3.2. HERMIT.
	3.3. STRUCTURAL_REASONER.
4. -f: This is an optional paramenter and it should contain once of the different formatters that have included in the tool:
	4.1 RDFXML.
	4.2 GRAPHVIZ [DEFAULT].
	4.3 FLATFILE.
	4.4 GRAPHML.
	4.5 *: The "*" set that all formatters will be applied.
5. -op: It is an optional parameter and it represents a list of object properties that will be added to the graph. The list o		of object properties should be formatted as array, here you can see an example: ["first_label","second_label",
	   "third_label"]. In order to include all object properties from the ontology given it is just needed to provide: [*] and then all object properties from the ontology will be added.  

An example of Onto2Graph execution without object properties would be:

java -jar Onto2Graph.jar -ont ./tests/GO_21.obo -out ./outputs/structural_reasoner_rdfxml -r STRUCTURAL_REASONER -f RDFXML

In this example we are using the following parameters:
-ont: In order to indicate the path where the ontology is located.
-out: The path where the graph will be serialized.
-r: In this example we are going to use the STRUCTURAL_REASONER
-f: The formatter that will be applied over the ontology file will be RDFXML. So, as a result the tool will provide a graph in RDFXML format.

An other example including all objects properties of the ontology would be:

java -jar Onto2Graph.jar -ont ./tests/GO_21.obo -out ./outputs/structural_reasoner_rdfxml -r STRUCTURAL_REASONER -f RDFXML -op [*]

Unlike the early example, as you can see, here we have object properties. So, in this case the parameters are: 
-ont: The path of the ontology that will be transformed into a graph.
-out: The output path.
-r: We are going to use the same reasoner that the example before shown.
-f: The formatter that will be applied, in this example will be RDFXML
-op: This parameter contains [*] which means all the object properties of the ontology will be included to the parse process of the ontology.
